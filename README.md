## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile vs. Waterfall: Pros & Cons
Agile:
Highly flexible and adaptive to change.
Continuous feedback and testing reduce risks.
Faster delivery of working software.
Less documentation, more focus on functionality.
Best for projects with evolving requirements.
Waterfall:
Follows a structured, step-by-step approach.
Changes are difficult and costly once development starts.
Strong documentation ensures clarity.
Works well for projects with fixed requirements.
Risk of discovering issues late in development.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile: Ideal for startups, mobile apps, and AI projects.
Waterfall: Best for banking systems, ERP, and hardware projects.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Ensures software reliability, security, and performance.
Best practices:
Use automated testing.
Conduct code reviews.
Perform user acceptance testing (UAT).
Monitor performance continuously.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining scope ensures clear objectives, prevents scope creep, and aligns stakeholders.
WBS breaks projects into smaller tasks, making planning, tracking, and resource allocation more manageable.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A structured schedule improves time management, resource planning, and risk mitigation.
Gantt charts provide a visual timeline, helping teams track progress and dependencies.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
The software solves specific pain points, improving efficiency, automation, or user experience.
These issues matter because they impact productivity, cost, or accessibility for users.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
A well-defined problem ensures a focused solution, minimizes wasted effort, and enhances user satisfaction.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
It’s an intuitive tool designed to solve [core problem] efficiently, making life easier for users.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Key features offer unique efficiency, automation, security, or user-friendly design, setting it apart.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
